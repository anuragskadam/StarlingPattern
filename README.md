# StarlingPattern

Starling Murmurations
- Starlings fly in highly complex looking patterns called murmuration. A YouTube video of this phenomenon is linked below.

- These patterns are formed by a phenomenon called *Emergence* which occurs when an entity is observed to have properties its parts do not have on their own, properties or behaviors that emerge only when the parts interact in a wider whole. Basically when a huge number of objects following simple rules turn out to forms highly complex structures.

Physics involved
- In my code these particles approximating starlings interact through a spring force (-kx) with n neighbouring birds.
- There is also a term of drag force which prevents the energy of the system from blowing up.

Code
- On running the code, main.py, at the end of the simulation an MP4 format video is created using OpenCV.
- Two sample videos namely "Starlings_video_1" and "Starlings_video_2" are already present in the repository for viewing the progress so far.
